## Build

World's Tiniest Desktop Pets was created in Unity **6000.0.19f1** (Unity 6 Preview) in C#.

All dependencies are included in the project.

Unfortunately, due to reliance on the Win32 API, this project is Windows exlusive. Feel free to try Wine emulation, or finding a cross platform approach to transparent windows.
